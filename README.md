# Tic-Tac-Toe

Who Doesn't love a classic game of tic-tac-toe!

This project was inspired by The Odin Project: Full Stack Ruby on Rails curriculum. 

## Functionality

This game is intended to be played within the users terminal. The program itself utilizes object oriented methodolgies (constants, instance variables, instance methods etc), conditional logic, loops, arrays, and built-in methods in its execution.

## Rules & Objective

- The objective of the game is to be the first player to mark 3 of your symbols in a row on the gameboard

- The gameboard consists of 9 positions, each marked from 1 to 9

- Each players will take turns selecting positions on the gameboard

- If a position has already been selected the player must select another position that is still available

- If neither player manages to mark 3 of his/her symbols in a row, it will result in a draw game

Enjoy!
